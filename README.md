Bagnell's Class Arduino Code

Simple Arduino code files for use in teaching Arduino Program Comprehension.


These code fragments were developed at home and are considered Personal Projects. I have used them during 
lectures at High Tech High, however they were not developed exclusively for this purpose.

File Index
============

test#.ino
------------
Test code files, they compile, they run, they do something. They contain no documentation. These are good for
asking students to describe what the code does.

issue#.ino
------------
Issue code files, they do not compile, nor do they run. They contain documentation. These are good for
teaching students to debug code and read compiler output.

testkey#.ino
------------
Test Key Files, These files are 'keys' for tests that I have developed. A PDF with the same name will be the test
document.

prompt#.txt
------------
Programming Prompt files, these are simple prompts that are used for teaching comprehension of developing code to solve
a problem

Notes
------------
As of writing this document, no issue, prompt or PDFs are currently uploaded or written. This repository will be
continually growing

If you've found my project useful and you wish to help fund further development with my Ardunio Teaching Tools,
I accept donations volunteer code, just write up some code, stick it in a gist, link it under the issues tab,
and I will add it to the repository (With credits of course)
